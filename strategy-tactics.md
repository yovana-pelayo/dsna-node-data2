Strategy and Tactics
===

For code challenge problems:
- Your planning and approach are your strategy
- Your specific lines of code are your tactics

The following two tendencies are signals that strategy or tactics are missing or incomplete

## Wandering

> Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory _- Sun Tzu_

Wandering happens when you have a good plan, but either haven't broken it down into specific steps (pseudo coding helpful), or you are weak on the specifics of JavaScript and imperative programming. 

## Thrashing

> Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat _- Sun Tzu_

Thrashing happens when you jump into coding without having a plan or thoughtful approach. For some reason, thrashers like to create arrays and put stuff in them.
